Add the following to your own OpenSim.ini file to make Search work:

[DataSnapshot]
    index_sims = true
    ;data_exposure = all
    data_exposure = minimum
    gridname = "Grid Name"
    default_snapshot_period = 1200
    snapshot_cache_directory = "DataSnapshot"
    ;data_services = "MOODLE_URL/blocks/modlos/helper/register.php"
    data_services = "XOOPS_URL/modules/xoopensim/helper/register.php"

[Modules]
    LandServices = "RemoteLandServicesConnector"

[Search]
; This is the URL needed for Search server to work  
; Change it to your own HTTP server to have Search inworld working
    ;SearchURL = MOODLE_URL/blocks/modlos/helper/query.php
    SearchURL = XOOPS_URL/modules/xoopensim/helper/query.php
