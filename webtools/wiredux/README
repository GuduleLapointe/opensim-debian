These are updates for the OpenSimWiredux to make Events and Classifieds work.

In order for this to work

1. Make a good backup of your database and website

2. Copy all the folders and files to your website

3. Open up the OpenSimWiredux in Admin mode (http://OpenSimWiredux/admin) and add 3 new items:

* Search
	- Events
	- Classifieds

4. Login as a normal user to check if the new items show up

5. Have fun using it
