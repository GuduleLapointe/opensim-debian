## Packaging

The packages are built with [nfpm](https://nfpm.goreleaser.com) and published to the Magiiic apt repository with the tools of apt-repo (`git@git.magiiic.com:magic/apt-repo.git`, cloned in `/opt/apt-repo`), whose README documents the whole chain. Everything lives in `packaging/`, one definition per package:

| Package                      | Definition              | Version                          | Content                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `opensim-tools`              | `opensim-tools.yaml`    | git tag of this repository       | the tools, in `/usr/share/opensim-tools`, the `opensim` command, the service                         |
| `opensim-<version>`          | `opensim-core.yaml`     | OpenSimulator release + revision | an OpenSimulator release, in `/usr/share/opensim/<version>`, for amd64 and arm64                     |
| `opensim`                    | `opensim.yaml`          | same as the latest release       | metapackage, the latest release                                                                      |
| `opensim-kit`                | `opensim-kit.yaml`      | git tag of this repository       | metapackage, the tools and the latest release                                                        |
| `opensim-unstable`           | `opensim-unstable.yaml` | source version, date and commit  | OpenSimulator built from the `upstream/opensim` submodule, in `/usr/share/opensim/unstable`          |
| `opensim-<core>-<module>`    | `opensim-<module>.yaml` | module version + revision        | a module for a release or `unstable`, in `/usr/share/opensim-modules/<core>/<module>`, not loaded until enabled |
| `opensim-manfredaabye-helpers`     | `opensim-manfredaabye-helpers.yaml` | date and commit of the source | the helpers of the manfredaabye fork of OpenSimSearch (`webroot` of `contrib/OpenSimSearch/src`, not the opensim-helpers of this project), in `/usr/share/opensim-manfredaabye-helpers`, settings in `/etc/opensim/manfredaabye-helpers` |

The tools and the releases install without each other. `opensim-tools` adds an install profile for each release in `/usr/share/opensim`, and removes it with the release, through a dpkg trigger.

The modules are installed in their own folders, as some fail when loaded without their config: installing one does not enable it. They only suggest their core, so a build made elsewhere can use them and removing a core keeps them. `opensim-kit` installs the handful of essential modules for the latest release; the others are only in the repository. Third-party terms are in `contrib/README.md` and in the `copyright` file of each module package (OpenSimSearch states no license, and is not covered by the license of this project).

Removing `opensim-<version>` or `opensim-unstable` stops the instances running from that core only, found by the full path of their assembly in the process list: instances of another release or of a build installed elsewhere are left alone. Nothing in an OpenSim instance needs a clean shutdown, its state is in the database, so a plain stop is enough.

The version of the tools and of the metapackages is the version tag when the build is on one, the release. Any other build carries the version being worked on, declared in `.version` (a pre-release such as `3.0.0-dev`): `3.0.0~dev.<commits>+g<sha>`, which sorts after the former dev builds and before the release. The tag goes on the release commit only, which updates `CHANGELOG.md` (the tag message repeats it); `.version` is bumped for the next development version after it, a pre-release that sorts after the tag (`3.0.0-beta.2` after `3.0.0-beta.1`, not `3.0.0-dev`: `~dev` sorts after `~beta`).

## Building and publishing

```bash
/opt/apt-repo/bin/apt-package                          # every package, into dist/
/opt/apt-repo/bin/apt-package opensim-tools            # only this one
/opt/apt-repo/bin/apt-package --publish                # publish, on a version tag of this repository
/opt/apt-repo/bin/apt-package --publish opensim-core opensim   # a new release, without a tag
```

Publishing skips the packages whose version is already in the repository, so the tools and the releases keep their own pace. The packages with the version of this repository need a version tag (`v3.0.0`, the `v` is optional), and are attached to its GitHub release, marked as a pre-release when the version has one (`v3.0.0-beta.1`).

`packaging/build` runs first and prepares only the packages asked for:

- `opensim-tools`: `build/opensim-tools` from the committed tree (`git archive HEAD`), with the PHP dependencies (`composer install --no-dev`), without the paths listed in `packaging/distignore`. Uncommitted changes are not packaged.
- `opensim-core`, `opensim`: the release of `packaging/opensim-core.versions`, the last one or `OPENSIM_VERSION`, e.g. `OPENSIM_VERSION=0.9.3.0 /opt/apt-repo/bin/apt-package opensim-core`. Its tarball is downloaded into `src/` and checked against its SHA256.

- `opensim-unstable`: OpenSimulator built from the commit of the `upstream/opensim` submodule (a shallow clone of the upstream repository, `master`), in a .NET SDK container (podman, or `CONTAINER=docker`). Each commit is built once, into `build/cache/`. Update it with `git submodule update --remote upstream/opensim`.
- `opensim-manfredaabye-helpers`: `build/manfredaabye-helpers`, the `webroot` of the OpenSimSearch source (`contrib/OpenSimSearch/src`, the `manfredaabye` tag, whose scripts are those of the original), without its settings, which are in `/etc`, and with the errors of the database going to the error log of PHP. Versioned `0.0~git<date>.<commit>` of the source, revision in `packaging/build`.
- `opensim-<module>`: the files listed for the module in `packaging/opensim-modules.versions`, for the release of `opensim-core`, or the core of `MODULES_CORE` (a release or `unstable`), e.g. `MODULES_CORE=unstable /opt/apt-repo/bin/apt-package opensim-gloebit`. The files downloaded go to `src/`, checked against their SHA256. The packages are named after the modules.

A new OpenSimulator release is added at the end of `packaging/opensim-core.versions`, with its checksum. A published package is never changed: a packaging change of a published release gets the next revision in that file, as for the modules in `packaging/opensim-modules.versions`.

The maintainer scripts of `opensim-tools` create the `opensim` account and the folders of the system layout, write the default `/etc/opensim/opensim.conf` when missing, and handle the `opensim` service like `dh_installsystemd`: enabled on first install, stopped with the instances on removal, never restarted by upgrades.

The scripts use the helpers of [bash-tools](https://github.com/magicoli/bash-tools): the `bash-tools` package, a dependency of `opensim-tools`, or composer's copy in a git checkout (`composer install`). It is a development dependency of composer, so the packages don't bundle it. During development, composer links the local `../bash-tools` checkout when there is one (path repository, `dev-dev`): switch to a released version before a release (and back to `dev-dev` with the path repository after it).

The PHP dependencies are locked for PHP 8.1 (`config.platform.php` in `composer.json`), the oldest PHP of the supported systems (Ubuntu 22.04).

The releases are installed read-only, so nothing may be written in their `bin/` folder at run time. OpenSim writes its platform `System.Drawing.Common.dll` there on start when it differs: the build puts it in place beforehand.

## Tests

One command runs every test, `vendor/bin/pest` (`composer test`): the PHP ones with [Pest](https://pestphp.com), the shell scripts with [bashunit](https://bashunit.typeddevs.com) (`tests/lib/bashunit`), run from Pest. Everything is in `tests/`:

- `tests/Environment`: the PHP minimum. It is read from `composer.json`, the composer platform must follow it, and `phpcs` with PHPCompatibility (`phpcs.xml.dist`) checks that the code needs nothing newer and uses nothing deprecated up to the newest PHP version listed in the test. It runs on the minimum PHP, 8.2 (pinned in `.php-version` for the tools that read it).
- `tests/Unit`: the shell scripts (`*-test.sh`, bashunit): they parse, and bash scripts use `#!/usr/bin/env bash`. Also `tests/lib/bashunit tests/Unit`.
- `tests/Packaging`: the packages and the container image, tested in containers (podman). Slow, they need podman and the packages of `dist/`, so they run only when asked, on a host that has them: `PACKAGING=1 vendor/bin/pest`. The scripts also run by hand, from the repository root.

`tests/Packaging/run` installs the packages of `dist/` in a container with systemd (podman): a release alone then the tools, a grid made by the wizard and run by the service, a simulator with its region joining that grid (its estate owner made through the console of Robust, a second region added while it runs), the console commands, the search service from its package to an indexed region, then upgrade, the other builds, removal of the tools and of the release, and purge:

```bash
tests/Packaging/run                                   # Debian 12
tests/Packaging/run docker.io/library/ubuntu:24.04    # Ubuntu 24.04
```

`scenario.sh` runs in the container, its scripted answers to the wizards are in `newgrid.php` and `newsim.php` (`ScriptedUi.php`). The container is capped to 700 MB (`MEMORY=1g tests/Packaging/run` to change it): the machine of podman is shared with every other container, and one that lacks memory stops the biggest process of any of them, not the one that asked for it. With the cap, the test does not reach the containers of the other projects as long as about 800 MB are free in that machine (the script says when they are not): stop the containers you do not need first, rather than giving the machine more memory. `KEEP=1` keeps the container for inspection.

`tests/Packaging/distro-pest` runs the Pest suites of the kit and of its libraries with the PHP of a distribution and only the extensions the packages depend on (`tests/Packaging/distro-pest docker.io/library/ubuntu:24.04` for another one): this is what checks that the PHP minimum and the dependencies of the packages are the real ones. `tests/Packaging/container-image` checks the container image.
