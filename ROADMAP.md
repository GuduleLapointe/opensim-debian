# Roadmap

## Fixes

- [ ] confirm on ubuntu 24.04 (ursull), with the next package and an outdated bash-tools left in composer global, that `opensim setup` no longer ends with `debug: command not found` (the scripts now load the bash-tools of the kit before the one of the `PATH`, see `libexec/load-helpers`)
- [ ] dependencies packages must be added to the release assets in their own repositories
- [x] opensim status "down" count should not be displayed when none of the instances are down
- [x] a new region is named after itself without a restart of the simulator (the object of `share/ossl-scripts`, loaded through the console)
- [ ] try to open ports if firewall is active (`opensim ports --ufw` only tells the rules)
- [ ] check `opensim stop` on a simulator with an NPC in it: the real users are counted from `show users`, the NPCs (`NPC Root`) are skipped, but only the format was checked on a real core, not an NPC
- [x] the simulators of a grid with helpers know where `offline.php` (`[Messaging]`) and `register.php` (`DATA_SRV_MISearch` of `[DataSnapshot]`) are
- [x] the message of the day: `[LoginService] MessageUrl` is a URL whose text is shown at login (read by Robust when it starts, `WelcomeMessage` when it cannot be), found in the code of the core (`LLLoginService`); `motd.php` of opensim-helpers serves the `motd` of `helpers.ini`
- [x] the destination guide is `guide.php` of the helpers, `DestinationGuide` of the Robust config points to it
- [ ] the search page of the web site: not in opensim-helpers (no branch has a page, only the backend behind `query.php`), it is probably in the WordPress plugin; find out where it reads from, so that it finds what `parser.php` indexes, and write the `search` URL of `[GridInfoService]` when it exists
- [ ] run again the packaging scenario beyond the upgrade step (the development build, removal, purge) and with the real `apt-package`: only the packages built by hand with nfpm were tested; run it with docker as well as podman
- [ ] try the web server examples written by the setup (`<grid>.caddyfile`, `<grid>-nginx.conf`, `<grid>-apache.conf`) on a real Caddy, nginx and Apache

## Critical improvements

- [x] bulk avatar creation (from a list provided by a third-party source: CSV, JSON or YAML), directly in the database, as `opensim import [grid] FILE --users`; relies on the install the profile gives, with or without the kit
- [ ] try the accounts made in the database with a viewer (login, inventory, default outfit) on a test grid, and check the numbers of the system folders (`Settings` 56 and `Material` 57) against the core
- [ ] test `opensim import` on real grids (the config of a grid or of a simulator, a setup file, a list of accounts: what works, what is missing)
- [x] add opensim-helpers package and examples of configuration as alias/subfolder in caddy, nginx and apache2
- [ ] add docker/podman installation support in setup
- [ ] rename composer packages to match github account GuduleLapointe
- [ ] parcel naming object: make it part of the library of the grid too (the original stays available to the users, a copy is rezzed in each new region), and let the operator choose what a new region gets at its start (name of the parcel, music, media, flags: the script is the place for it)
- [ ] OSSL: the standard config enables the functions with the defaults of the core; let the operator customize them (which functions, for whom)

## Next steps

- [ ] add full import procedure for existing grids/simulators: the config is imported (`opensim import`), the database, the assets and the other data are not
- [x] add/update bash completion
- [ ] build ready to use zip packages for simple download, added to the release assets alongside the source code and apt package
- [ ] add simplified installation script, detecting the platform and installing with the appropriate method (zip package or apt package), with a one-line command like `curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GuduleLapointe/opensim-kit/refs/heads/master/install.sh | bash`
- [x] add basic ready to use website (the placeholder site of the `opensim-web` package)
- [ ] add ready to use default avatars
- [ ] add default Inventory package
- [ ] add nat/port forwarding instructions or presets (with standard tools or third-party provides like ngrok, cloudflare...)
- [ ] make most opensim-tools features installation-agnostic (support both opensim-kit and custom/standard opensim installations): `/etc/opensim/opensim.conf` becomes only a reference pointing to the user's actual core installation and configuration files location (e.g. `/opt/osgrid`, `~/diva`, `~/opensim/opensim-0.9.3.0/bin`...)
  - [x] `opensim profile list|add|default|remove` registers an install made by hand (core, config and data directories)
  - [ ] a grid follows the profile of its own install, the default profile is only the default of the new grids
  - [ ] the system user to run the instances as is per profile, not only `SystemUser` of `[Defaults]`
  - [ ] the setup offers to register an install (the core menu), and no script assumes `/etc/opensim`, `/var/lib/opensim` or `/usr/share/opensim` (review, one fix per file, with a test)
- [ ] test the OpenSimSearch module from end to end with a parcel shown in search: the chain works up to the snapshot (the sim registers on `register.php`, `parser.php` fetches it, `query.php` answers); a new region has no searchable parcel, the flag is `ShowDirectory` = 4096 in `Flags` of the `land` table of the simulator, to set in the test then check that `query.php` finds the parcel
- [ ] add to the README of opensim-helpers (and of the engine) a short section on how to use them with the OpenSim kit
- [ ] install instructions in the README of `lsl-ossl-zed` (rust, clone, `zed: install dev extension`, the prebuilt LSP binaries only cover Linux x86_64 and macOS)

## Less urgent

- [x] localize the setup with gettext (a requirement of the project): the messages of the PHP setup are translatable (`locales/`, `locales/update-pot`)
- [ ] localize the launcher and the bash scripts with gettext
- [ ] a first translation of the setup (`locales/fr.po`)
- [ ] localize helpers
- [ ] `opensim online`: show who's online

## Could be great

- [ ] Memory/CPU usage monitoring. Notify admin and/or restart Sim above given thresholds. Thinking twice about previous notify thing: maybe it's better to suggest a dedicated monitoring tool handle that.
