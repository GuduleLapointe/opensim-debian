README

This directory does not currently contain any OpenSimulator user level documentation.  Such
documentation can be found at

http://opensimulator.org

instead.

Rather, this directory can contain source-code documentation as generated via the doxygen package.

To do this, either execute

doxygen doxygen.conf 

on the command line or run the target

nant doxygen

if you have nant installed.
