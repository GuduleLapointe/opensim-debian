; The HGAssetService section controls the connection given to the AssetService in a Hypergrid configuration.
; This has to be separate from [AssetService] because the Hypergrid facing connector uses [HGAssetService] for its config data instead.
; However, the internal asset service will still use the [AssetService] section.
; Therefore, you will almost certainly want the ConnectionString in [HGAssetService] to be the same as in [AssetService] 
; so that they both access the same database.
; This issue does not apply to normal MySQL/MSSQL configurations, since by default they use the settings in [DatabaseService] and
; do not have separate connection strings for different services.
