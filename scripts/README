These are some scripts, some we created, some we modified to fix bug or to add useful functionalties.

We use .lsl for all of them because our script editor likes that.
The scripts ending with .ossl.lsl extension use OpenSimulator specific futions.
The ones with only .lsl should also work on Second Life.

Archive Box:
A simple archive script. Drop it in a prim, then drop objects to archive. The prim will display (on its faces) the name of the first item dropped. And the box becomes an object giver: if you click, it gives you it's content, except the archive script, in a properly named folder.

Linkset resizer
A bug fix on existing Linkset resize (aka resize_script) found in lot of clothing attachment, it should avoid the object being broken if the resize is made while the object is worn.


Gudule's HG Board
This is a fusion between our original "Gudule's gate" and Jeff Kelley's HG Board, allowing better presentation, transparent backgrounds and a few other modifications.

fetchTextureWithOsDraw
Texture maker, takes a title (from object description or send by other scripts) and applies it as a texture, using an external text generation library (like its predecessor) or using osDraw functions.

OpenSimulator version display
Just display OS version. The script existed already but I wanted to get rid of extra space between version number and platform.

comboReadPrefs
A helper script to read a preference notecard and send values to other scripts via linked message.


DEPRECATED:

Gudule's gate
Legacy teleport gate script, used in parallel with fetchTexture scripts to display the gate name on the prim instead of ugly hovering text. Deprecated by HG Board.

fetchTextureFromTextGen
Original texture maker, deprecated by fetchTextureWithOsDraw

HYPevents (deprecated)
Modifications were made to HYPevents boad version 0.6, the original has been updated in the meantime. Only here for historical purpose.
Some additions to HYPevents inworld script, to allow a better presentation (different styles for hour and event title, column alignment...). These changes were included by the author in the official release so you should rather check HYPEvents online (https://hypevents.net/) or in-world (hypergrid.org:8002:Linkwater_South) for the latest version.
